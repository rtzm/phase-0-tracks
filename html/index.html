	<h1>Erik Erikson</h1>
	<p>This is a page about psychologist Erik Erikson, who is my <em>favorite</em> psychologist.</p>
	<p>Why is he my favorite? Here are a few reasons, in no particular order:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He was a good writer.</li>
		<li>He had a very interesting theory about development.</li>
		<li>He took growth more seriously than Freud.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now you know why I like him. Here are the stages of his theory of development, taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson's_stages_of_psychosocial_development">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Hope: trust vs. mistrust (oral-sensory, infancy, 0–2 years)</li>
		<li>Will: autonomy vs. shame and doubt (early childhood, 2–4 years)</li>
		<li>Purpose: initiative vs. guilt (locomotor-genital, preschool, 4–5 years)</li>
		<li>Competence: industry vs. inferiority (latency, school age, 5–12 years)</li>
		<li>Fidelity: identity vs. role confusion (adolescence, 13–19 years)</li>
		<li>Love: intimacy vs. isolation (early adulthood, 20-39 years)</li>
		<li>Care: generativity vs. stagnation (adulthood, 40–64 years)
		<li>Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair (maturity, 65 – death)</li>
	</ol>
