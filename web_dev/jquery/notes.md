Plan for studying jQuery:

- 10 minutes - find resources on when and why to use jQuery, find resources on how to use it, find a way to test it out in a structured test environment, and find some best practices
- 15 minutes - read when and why to use jQuery
- 5 minute break
- 30 minutes - read how to use it, syntax, etc
- 5 minute break
- 20 minutes - play around with it for a little bit
- 5 minute break
- 15 minutes - find some resources on best practices, docs, and a cheat sheet

Review of how the study went:

I think it was a good idea to timeblock how much time I would spend gathering resources before reading them, and searching out more intentionally for what I thought I needed. As I was going along, I think the resources on when to use jQuery and when not to use it were the most useful, since they gave me a stronger sense of what I should be reading for and how I could imagine using it as I was reading the more syntactical resources. I also think I could have structured the "play around" section a bit more. I considered using some resources to do that on jQuery.com, but I think I got bored with those, and preferred to do trial and error on a jsfiddle. I didn't end up looking for best practices at the end, but I did find the docs, which I think was more helpful than a best practices resource, ultimately.
