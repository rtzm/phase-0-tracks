# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool to create different versions of the same directory, so that you can revert to old versions, merge parallel versions, or take the code off in a new direction. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

You would use a branch if you wanted to make changes without affecting the main version of a directory, and jeopardizing your codebase. You could also make a branch if you wanted to test something out, or work on a specific part of the file while others work on other parts.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is like a save point that you can take the directory back to if something happens. A good commit message will explain what you did since the last commit in a short but clear way.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when there are two changes that mutually conflict with each other, and the branch can't be merged back into the master. This might happen if the branch contains a change to a line of code that was changed in another branch. You then have to go in and select which version of that line you want to keep.

Here's a new line of new information.
